    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
    <p><strong>For the ProfitGuard Returns Calculator Shopify App</strong></p>

    <h3>What is the difference between the Essential and Pro plans?</h3>
    <p>Both are paid subscription plans, and each comes with a 14-day free trial. The <strong>Essential Plan</strong> gives you access to our powerful Returns Calculator and History log. The <strong>Pro Plan</strong> includes everything in Essential, plus advanced features like the customer-facing Returns Portal, automated return rules, and abuse prevention.</p>

    <h3>Is my store and customer data safe?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Data security is my top priority. For the Essential plan, I only access anonymous order and product data. For the Pro plan, I require minimal customer data (email and order ID) to operate the returns portal and abuse-prevention features. I never access sensitive information and never share your data.</p>
    
    <h3>How do I use the Returns Calculator?</h3>
    <p>From the app's main dashboard, simply enter an order number. The app will fetch the order details, and you can then input your return shipping and handling fees to see a complete profit/loss analysis for that return.</p>

    <h3>How do I set up the Customer Returns Portal (Pro Plan)?</h3>
    <p>After upgrading to Pro, go to your theme editor (Online Store -> Themes -> Customize). In the editor, navigate to "Add section" or "Add block" and select the "Returns Portal" block. You can add it to your homepage, a dedicated page, or any other section of your store.</p>

    <h3>What is your refund policy?</h3>
    <p>Due to the nature of my digital service, I do not offer refunds for subscription fees. If you are experiencing technical issues, please contact my support, and I will do my best to resolve the problem.</p>
