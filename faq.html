    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
    <p><strong>For the ProfitGuard Returns Calculator Shopify App</strong></p>

    <h3>What is the difference between the Essential and Pro plans?</h3>
    <p>Our <strong>Essential Plan is free forever</strong> and gives you access to our powerful Returns Calculator and History log. The <strong>Pro Plan</strong> is a paid subscription that unlocks advanced features, including the customer-facing Returns Portal, automated return rules, and abuse prevention.</p>

    <h3>Is my store and customer data safe?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Data security is our top priority. For our free plan, we only access anonymous order and product data. For our Pro plan, we require minimal customer data (email and order ID) to operate the returns portal and abuse-prevention features. We never access sensitive information and never share your data.</p>
    
    <h3>How do I use the Returns Calculator?</h3>
    <p>From the app's main dashboard, simply enter an order number. The app will fetch the order details, and you can then input your return shipping and handling fees to see a complete profit/loss analysis for that return.</p>

    <h3>How do I set up the Customer Returns Portal (Pro Plan)?</h3>
    <p>After upgrading to Pro, go to your theme editor (Online Store -> Themes -> Customize). In the editor, navigate to "Add section" or "Add block" and select the "Returns Portal" block. You can add it to your homepage, a dedicated page, or any other section of your store.</p>

    <h3>What is your refund policy?</h3>
    <p>Due to the nature of our digital service, we do not offer refunds for subscription fees. If you are experiencing technical issues, please contact our support, and we will do our best to resolve the problem.</p>
